Known Issues

Array Size Limit: No validation prevents size > 100, which can cause buffer overflow
Zero Size Array: Accepts size = 0, may cause undefined behavior
Memory Management: Merge sort uses dynamic allocation but other arrays are static
print is happening in sorting so it may give unexpected time for sorting
